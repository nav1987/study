The Cocoa Touch frameworks provide the general capabilities needed by any iOS
application. Buttons can be tapped, text can be read, screens of interface can succeed
one another, because Cocoa makes it so. To use the framework, you must learn to let
the framework use you. You must put your code in the right place so that it will be
called at the right time. You must fulfill certain obligations that Cocoa expects of you.
You master Cocoa by being Cocoa’s obedient servant. In this part of the book, that’s
what you’ll learn to do.
